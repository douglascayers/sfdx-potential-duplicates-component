Inspired by [David Giller](https://twitter.com/davidgiller/status/1026934520560283648?s=11),
who was looking for a way to use the standard [Potential Duplicates component](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=duplicates_existing_setup.htm&type=5) 
on a Lightning record page for custom objects.

The standard component only supports Accounts, Contacts, and Leads.

This project introduces a custom component that supports all objects.
